# Obsolete GO:0043713 (R)-2-hydroxyisocaproate dehydrogenase activity

This PR obsoletes GO:0043713 and replaces it with GO:0140175 (2R)-2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase (NAD+) activity, addressing issue #31966.

## Rationale

GO:0043713 describes a specific enzymatic activity that is already captured by the broader term GO:0140175:

- **GO:0043713**: Specific to (R)-2-hydroxyisocaproate
- **GO:0140175**: Covers all (2R)-2-hydroxyacids, including (R)-2-hydroxyisocaproate

The equivalence is supported by:
1. EC:1.1.1.345 "D-2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase (NAD+)" explicitly lists "(R)-2-hydroxyisocaproate dehydrogenase" as a synonym
2. GO:0140175 is mapped to EC:1.1.1.345 (exactMatch)
3. RHEA:10052, which describes the specific reaction with (2R)-hydroxy-4-methylpentanoate (systematic name for (R)-2-hydroxyisocaproate), is listed as a narrowMatch xref on GO:0140175

## Research Conducted

Comprehensive research was performed to verify the biological and chemical relationships:

### EC and RHEA Verification
- Confirmed EC:1.1.1.345 synonyms include both "D-2-hydroxyisocaproate dehydrogenase" and "(R)-2-hydroxyisocaproate dehydrogenase"
- Verified RHEA:10052 involves the same substrate using systematic nomenclature
- Sources: BRENDA, ExplorEnz, EXPASY ENZYME databases

### Chemical Nomenclature
- CHEBI:55534 is (R)-2-hydroxy-4-methylpentanoic acid, synonym "(R)-2-hydroxyisocaproic acid"
- CHEBI:55535 is the conjugate base (R)-2-hydroxy-4-methylpentanoate
- "Isocaproate" and "4-methylpentanoate" refer to the same structure

### Literature Support
- PMID:16957230 (Kim et al., 2006) characterizes (R)-2-hydroxyisocaproate dehydrogenase from C. difficile
- The enzyme is stereospecific for the R-isomer
- Substrates: 2-oxoisocaproate + NADH → (R)-2-hydroxyisocaproate + NAD+

Full research findings documented in accompanying research notes.
