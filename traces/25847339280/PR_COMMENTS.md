# Update carbon monoxide dehydrogenase terms to align with EC/RHEA definitions

This PR addresses issue #31984 by updating GO:0008805 and GO:0043885 to align with authoritative EC and RHEA nomenclature and reaction definitions.

## Summary of Changes

### GO:0008805 (carbon-monoxide oxygenase activity → aerobic carbon monoxide dehydrogenase activity)

**Name change:**
- **Old:** carbon-monoxide oxygenase activity
- **New:** aerobic carbon monoxide dehydrogenase activity
- **Rationale:** Aligns with EC:1.2.5.3 official nomenclature "aerobic carbon monoxide dehydrogenase" and matches the naming pattern of the anaerobic form (GO:0043885)

**Definition change:**
- **Old:** "Catalysis of the reaction: CO + H2O + ferrocytochrome b-561 = CO2 + 2 H+ + 2 ferricytochrome b-561."
- **New:** "Catalysis of the reaction: CO + a quinone + H2O = a quinol + CO2."
- **Rationale:** Corrects the electron acceptor from cytochrome b-561 to quinone, matching RHEA:48880 and supported by biochemical evidence (PMID:21275368)

**Reparenting:**
- **Old parent:** GO:0016622 (oxidoreductase activity, acting on the aldehyde or oxo group of donors, cytochrome as acceptor)
- **New parent:** GO:0052738 (oxidoreductase activity, acting on the aldehyde or oxo group of donors, with a quinone or similar compound as acceptor)
- **Rationale:** EC:1.2.5.3 classification indicates quinone as acceptor (EC:1.2.5.- denotes quinone-accepting oxidoreductases)

### GO:0043885 (anaerobic carbon-monoxide dehydrogenase activity)

**Definition change:**
- **Old:** "Catalysis of the reaction: CO + H2O + oxidized ferredoxin = CO2 + reduced ferredoxin."
- **New:** "Catalysis of the reaction: CO + 2 oxidized [2Fe-2S]-[ferredoxin] + H2O = 2 reduced [2Fe-2S]-[ferredoxin] + CO2 + 2 H+."
- **Rationale:** 
  - Specifies [2Fe-2S] cluster type to match RHEA:21040 and EC:1.2.7.4
  - Includes correct stoichiometry (2 ferredoxin molecules)
  - Adds H+ products for chemical balance
  - Follows established GO precedent for [2Fe-2S]-ferredoxin notation (see DESIGN_PATTERNS.md)

## Biological Accuracy

The changes are biologically accurate based on:

1. **Aerobic carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (GO:0008805):**
   - Contains a binuclear Mo-Cu cluster, two [2Fe-2S] clusters, and FAD
   - Found in carboxydotrophic bacteria (e.g., Oligotropha carboxydovorans, Hydrogenophaga pseudoflava)
   - Quinones are the physiological electron acceptors (PMID:21275368)
   - Electrons transfer from Mo → [2Fe-2S] clusters → FAD → quinone pool
   - NO cytochrome intermediary is used

2. **Anaerobic carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (GO:0043885):**
   - Contains Ni-Fe-S clusters (different from aerobic form)
   - Found in methanogens, acetogens, sulfate-reducing bacteria
   - Uses [2Fe-2S]-ferredoxin as electron acceptor
   - Catalyzes reversible CO₂/CO conversion in anaerobic metabolism

## Design Pattern Conformance

Both changes conform to established GO design patterns:

1. **Quinone-based reaction** (GO:0008805): Follows pattern from GO:0003955 and other EC:1.2.5.- terms
2. **[2Fe-2S]-ferredoxin notation** (GO:0043885): Consistent with multiple GO precedents (see DESIGN_PATTERNS.md)
3. **No logical definitions:** Appropriately omitted as these are leaf-level MF terms where intersection_of would be over-specification
