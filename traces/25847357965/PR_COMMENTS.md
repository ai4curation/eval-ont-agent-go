# Add new term: protein O-linked glycosylation via N-acetylglucosamine (GO:7770074)

This PR addresses issue #32044 by creating a new biological process term for protein O-linked glycosylation via N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAcylation).

## Changes Made

### New Term Created
- **ID**: GO:7770074
- **Name**: protein O-linked glycosylation via N-acetylglucosamine
- **Namespace**: biological_process
- **Parent**: GO:0006493 (protein O-linked glycosylation)

### Definition
"A glycoprotein biosynthetic process in which a single N-acetylglucosamine is covalently linked via a beta-glycosidic bond to the oxygen atom of a serine or threonine side chain in a protein, resulting in the formation of a protein O-linked glycan. The sugar is not elongated into a larger oligosaccharide chain." [PMID:35536957]

### Synonyms
- protein O-linked GlcNAcylation [EXACT]
- protein O-linked-N-acetylglucosaminylation [EXACT]
- protein O-GlcNAcylation [EXACT]

## Rationale

This term was requested to enable proper annotation of genes such as Drosophila Ogt and Eogt (and their orthologs) at the same level of granularity as other O-linked glycosylation pathways. While O-GlcNAcylation represents a single-step reaction and a corresponding molecular function term exists (GO:0097363 "protein O-acetylglucosaminyltransferase activity"), the requestor correctly noted that a biological process term is needed for consistency with sister terms like:
- GO:0180059 protein O-linked glycosylation via glucose
- GO:0180062 protein O-linked glycosylation via galactose
- GO:0036066 protein O-linked glycosylation via fucose
- GO:0016266 protein O-linked glycosylation via N-acetyl-galactosamine

## Biological Context

O-GlcNAcylation is a unique post-translational modification with distinct characteristics:
1. **Single sugar modification**: Unlike other O-linked glycosylation processes where sugars can be extended into oligosaccharide chains, intracellular O-GlcNAcylation (OGT-mediated) typically involves a single N-acetylglucosamine that is not extended
2. **Reversible and dynamic**: Functions more like phosphorylation than traditional glycosylation, with rapid cycling on and off proteins
3. **Simple regulatory machinery**: Only 2 enzymes regulate the cycle (OGT adds, OGA removes), compared to ~500 kinases and ~150 phosphatases for phosphorylation
4. **Multiple catalytic enzymes**: Both OGT (intracellular) and EOGT (extracellular, ER-localized) catalyze this modification, though with different properties

## Files Modified
- `src/ontology/go-edit.obo` - Added new term GO:7770074

## Validation Notes

The full `make travis_build` validation suite could not be executed in this environment due to missing dependencies (scala-cli, robot). However, the term was validated through:
1. Successful checkin using obo-checkin.pl (which performs basic syntax validation)
2. Manual verification of term structure against established patterns
3. Verification that parent term exists and is appropriate
4. Confirmation that term ID is unique and has no conflicts

The term structure is consistent with all sister terms and follows established GO conventions. Full validation should complete successfully in the CI environment.

## Next Steps

This term can now be used to annotate:
- Drosophila Ogt (O-GlcNAc transferase) - FlyBase: FBgg0002104
- Drosophila Eogt (EGF domain-specific O-GlcNAc transferase) - FlyBase: FBgg0002104
- Orthologs across species

The term provides the appropriate level of granularity for distinguishing O-GlcNAcylation annotations from other types of O-linked glycosylation.
