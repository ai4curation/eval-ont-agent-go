## Rationale

### Naming and synonym

The original request proposed `ferritin-specific autophagy`. @ValWood proposed standardizing on `ferritinophagy` (consistent with `mitophagy`, `pexophagy`, `aggrephagy`, `ribophagy`, `proteaphagy`, `lysophagy`, `glycophagy`, `lipophagy`, `xenophagy`, `nucleophagy`, etc.) with `ferritin-specific autophagy` as an EXACT synonym. That is what is implemented here.

### Definition

Adopted @ValWood's standardized form:

> "The selective degradation of ferritin to release iron by macroautophagy."

This matches the established formula `"The selective degradation of <X> by macroautophagy."` used by sibling terms (aggrephagy, ribophagy, proteaphagy, glycophagy, lipophagy) while adding the biologically informative `to release iron` clause that reflects the functional outcome highlighted in the cited literature.

### Parentage

Single `is_a: GO:0016236 ! macroautophagy`, mirroring the existing selective-autophagy siblings. No `intersection_of` was added: as with aggrephagy/ribophagy/proteaphagy, there is no fully necessary-and-sufficient compositional template here, and over-specification (e.g. an `occurs_in` style intersection) would be inappropriate. The cargo (ferritin) is implicit in the name and definition.

I considered adding a second `is_a` to an iron-related parent (as `glycophagy` does with `GO:0005980 glycogen catabolic process`), but there is no comparably specific `ferritin catabolic process` parent, and `iron ion homeostasis` is a part_of/regulates relationship rather than an is_a — so a single parent is cleanest.

### References

All three PMIDs were verified via PubMed:

- **PMID:25327288** — Dowdle et al. 2014, *Nat Cell Biol*, "Selective VPS34 inhibitor blocks autophagy and uncovers a role for NCOA4 in ferritin degradation and iron homeostasis in vivo."
- **PMID:26436293** — Mancias et al. 2015, *eLife*, "Ferritinophagy via NCOA4 is required for erythropoiesis and is regulated by iron dependent HERC2-mediated proteolysis."

## Validation

- `obo-grep.pl` confirmed no ID/alt_id collision for `GO:7770069`.
- New term created in `terms/GO_7770069.obo` and merged via `obo-checkin.pl` (no direct editing of `go-edit.obo`).
- `robot convert -i go-edit.obo -f obo` — passes (no syntax errors).
- `robot reason -r ELK -i go-edit.obo` — passes (no unsatisfiability, term classifies under `macroautophagy`).
- `robot verify` against all 16 SPARQL QC rules — all PASS, 0 violations:
  - equivalent-classes-violation, trailing-whitespace-violation, owldef-self-reference-violation, synonym-label-match-violation, replacedby-obsolete-violation, replacedby-namespace-violation, missing-namespace-violation, duplicate-exact-synonym-violation, duplicate-synonym-violation, non-IRI-value-violation, non-anyURI-value-violation, obsolete-definition-violation, definition-constraints-violation, one-to-one-xrefs-by-subject-violation, one-to-one-xrefs-by-value-violation, xref-syntax-violation.

## Checklist

- [x] PLAN — issue analyzed, intent clear (single NTR with curator-standardized name/def), plan formed
- [x] PRE-VALIDATION — ontology converts and reasons cleanly before changes; ID `GO:7770069` confirmed unused
- [x] RESEARCH — N/A as a full /research deep-dive; the three requested PMIDs were verified against PubMed
- [x] TERM-SEARCH — confirmed no existing `ferritinophagy`/`ferritin-specific autophagy` term; surveyed sibling selective-autophagy terms (aggrephagy, ribophagy, proteaphagy, glycophagy, lysophagy)
- [x] DESIGN-PATTERNS — followed the established selective-autophagy pattern by prior-art (no formal DP doc covers this category; the sibling pattern is consistent and dominant)
- [x] EDITS — used `terms/` checkout/checkin flow; did not edit `go-edit.obo` directly
- [x] RELATIONSHIPS — single `is_a: GO:0016236 macroautophagy`, matches sibling pattern; no over-asserted intersection_of
- [x] SPECIALIZED-EDITS — N/A (no obsoletion, no CHEBI changes, no RHEA/EC, no taxon constraint)
- [x] METADATA — `created_by: dragon-ai-agent`, `creation_date` stamped, `term_tracker_item` links to issue #30894, definition has three validated PMIDs
- [x] AUTOMATED-VALIDATION — `robot convert`, `robot reason -r ELK`, and all 16 SPARQL QC checks pass
- [x] REFERENCE-VALIDATION — all three PMIDs confirmed via PubMed and are directly on-topic for ferritinophagy/NCOA4
- [x] CHANGES-COMMITTED — single commit, only `src/ontology/go-edit.obo` modified
