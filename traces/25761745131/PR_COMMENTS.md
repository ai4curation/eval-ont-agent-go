# PR Comments: Add protein O-linked glycosylation via N-acetylglucosamine term

## Overview

This PR adds a new biological process term GO:7770074 to represent the specific glycosylation process catalyzed by O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and EGF-domain O-GlcNAc transferase (EOGT). The term was requested in issue #32044 to enable granular annotation of genes like *Drosophila melanogaster* Ogt and Eogt, and their orthologs.

## Term Details

### Full Term Specification

```obo
[Term]
id: GO:7770074
name: protein O-linked glycosylation via N-acetylglucosamine
namespace: biological_process
def: "A glycoprotein biosynthetic process in which a single N-acetylglucosamine is covalently linked via a beta-glycosidic bond to the oxygen atom of a serine or threonine side chain in a protein, resulting in the formation of a protein O-linked glycan. The sugar is not elongated into a larger oligosaccharide chain." [PMID:35536957]
synonym: "protein O-linked GlcNAcylation" EXACT []
synonym: "protein O-linked-N-acetylglucosaminylation" EXACT []
is_a: GO:0006493 ! protein O-linked glycosylation
property_value: term_tracker_item "https://github.com/geneontology/go-ontology/issues/32044" xsd:anyURI

```

### Design Pattern Analysis

This term follows the established pattern for O-linked glycosylation variants:
- **Naming pattern:** "protein O-linked glycosylation via [sugar]" - consistent with GO:0016266, GO:0180059, GO:0180062, etc.
- **Definition format:** Genus (glycoprotein biosynthetic process) + key differentia (sugar-specific details)
- **Logical structure:** Simple is_a relationship (no intersection_of needed) - consistent with sibling terms
- **Key distinguishing feature:** Definition explicitly states "not elongated" - this is the critical difference from other O-linked glycosylations

### Biological Rationale

Unlike other O-linked glycosylations (e.g., GalNAc-initiated mucin-type glycosylation), the O-GlcNAcylation process typically results in a single, non-elongated sugar residue. This modification is:
1. **Reversible** - catalyzed by OGT/EOGT for addition and OGA for removal
2. **Single-step** - does not typically proceed to larger oligosaccharides (unlike GalNAc glycosylation)
3. **Dynamic** - plays key regulatory roles in cellular processes
4. **Species-universal** - occurs in diverse organisms from insects to mammals

Creating this distinct term allows annotators to specify genes like *Dmel* Ogt and Eogt at the same granular level as their functional counterparts (e.g., genes catalyzing GalNAc-initiated glycosylation), improving semantic precision in the GO annotation corpus.
