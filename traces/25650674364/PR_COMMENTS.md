## Summary

Adds a new cellular_component term to address geneontology/go-ontology#31295:

- **ID:** GO:7770070
- **Label:** p24 cargo receptor complex
- **Parent:** GO:0062137 *cargo receptor complex* (`is_a`)
- **Relationship:** `capable_of_part_of` GO:0006888 *endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi vesicle-mediated transport*

### Term as added

```
[Term]
id: GO:7770070
name: p24 cargo receptor complex
namespace: cellular_component
def: "A hetero-oligomeric cargo receptor complex that cycles between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus, and that selects secretory cargo, especially GPI-anchored proteins, for packaging into COPII vesicles at ER exit sites. A functional p24 complex typically contains one member of each of the alpha, beta, gamma and delta p24 protein subfamilies."

## Rationale

### Definition
The requester's free-text definition focused on ER exit site localisation and COPII cargo selection. ValWood's follow-up comment supplied biological detail (hetero-oligomeric, often tetrameric, ER–Golgi cycling, GPI-anchored cargo preference, one member of each α/β/γ/δ subfamily) that is sufficiently characteristic of this complex to belong in the term definition. The definition above combines both, with the cargo-selection role retained as the discriminating aspect.

### Axiomatisation
Followed the pattern of the existing sibling GO:0061852 *retrograde cargo receptor complex, Golgi to ER*, which uses:

- `is_a: GO:0062137`
- `relationship: capable_of_part_of <relevant transport process>`

…rather than asserting an `intersection_of` logical definition. A logical definition would have required an explicit cargo-receptor activity sub-term (one does not exist for "GPI-anchored protein cargo receptor activity") and/or over-specifying a unique cellular localisation. The complex cycles between ER and Golgi, so neither a single `part_of` membrane location nor a tighter `occurs_in` is appropriate.

### What was deliberately *not* added

- **No COPI/retrograde axiom.** The complex is also recycled back to the ER via COPI vesicles and is implicated in COPI vesicle formation (PMC2265561), but its defining role is anterograde cargo selection. Adding a second `capable_of_part_of` to GO:0006890 (Golgi → ER retrograde) would be reasonable; flagged in the issue thread for the requester's call.
- **No `part_of` membrane.** The parent already asserts `part_of some membrane`. A child localised to a specific membrane would inherit/override; the p24 complex is membrane-resident but moves between ER and Golgi membranes, so I left this inherited.
- **No new MF child term.** ValWood notes the complex itself has cargo receptor activity, which is already captured by the inherited `capable_of GO:0038024` from the parent. A bespoke "GPI-anchored protein cargo receptor activity" MF could be added separately if desired.

## Checklist

- [x] **PLAN** — issue analysed; intent (new CC term for p24 complex) clear from the May 6 request "@dragon-ai-agent please add this complex term"
- [N/A] **PRE-VALIDATION** — `robot` not available in this evaluation environment; ontology syntax verified via `obo-grep.pl` round-trip and the `obo-checkin.pl` script succeeded
- [N/A] **RESEARCH** — required references were supplied in the issue and the comment from ValWood; no additional literature search needed
- [x] **TERM-SEARCH** — confirmed no existing `p24`, `emp24`, or `TMED` complex in `go-edit.obo`; confirmed parent GO:0062137 and process GO:0006888 exist
- [x] **DESIGN-PATTERNS** — checked `protein_complex_by_activity` DP and existing sibling axiomatisation (GO:0061852); chose to mirror sibling rather than use an `intersection_of` to avoid over-specification
- [x] **EDITS** — used the `terms/` checkout/checkin procedure (`obo-checkin.pl src/ontology/go-edit.obo terms/GO_7770070.obo`)
- [x] **RELATIONSHIPS** — `is_a` parent + `capable_of_part_of` process, matching prior art for cargo receptor complex children
  - [x] no over-asserted `intersection_of`
  - [x] single `is_a` (consistent with edit-file pre-reasoned convention)
- [N/A] **SPECIALIZED-EDITS** — not an obsoletion, CHEBI, RHEA/EC, or taxon-constraint change
- [x] **METADATA** — `id`, `name`, `namespace`, `def` with five PMID xrefs, `created_by`, `creation_date`, `term_tracker_item` all present
- [N/A] **AUTOMATED-VALIDATION** — `robot` / `make travis_build` not available locally; needs CI to confirm
- [x] **REFERENCE-VALIDATION** — all five PMIDs taken verbatim from the issue body and ValWood's "def synthesised form" comment; none fabricated
- [x] **CHANGES-COMMITTED** — single commit on `src/ontology/go-edit.obo`
