### Definition
"A process by which an organism causes inflammatory response in another organism via the action of a venom."

## Biological Justification

The new term is supported by strong experimental evidence from studies on snake venom metalloproteinases (SVMPs). These venom components actively trigger inflammatory responses in envenomated organisms, characterized by:

1. **Edema formation** - tissue swelling (70% increase in paw size in experimental models)
2. **Leukocyte infiltration** - white blood cell recruitment to affected tissues (5-6 × 10^6 cells in experimental models)
3. **Release of inflammatory mediators** - production of cytokines such as TNF-α

Both references demonstrate that venom metalloproteinases from Bothrops species directly cause inflammatory responses through both direct action on inflammatory cells and indirect effects via basement membrane degradation.

## Design Rationale

The term follows the established pattern for venom-mediated terms in GO:
- Simple structure with is_a relationship (like GO:0044398)
- No logical definitions (appropriate for broad causative process)
- Standard naming: "venom-mediated [effect]"
- Standard definition: "A process by which an organism causes [effect] in another organism via the action of a venom"

This approach avoids over-specification and maintains consistency with existing venom-mediated terms that describe broad causative processes rather than specific regulatory mechanisms.

## Future Considerations

The original issue (#31902) mentioned additional related terms that may be added in the future:
- Venom-mediated leukocyte infiltration (as child of GO:7770071)
- Venom-mediated release of inflammatory mediator (as child of GO:7770071)
- Adding part_of relationship from GO:0044398 (venom-mediated edema) to GO:7770071

However, this PR focuses on the specific request from @pgaudet to add the parent term "venom-mediated activation of inflammatory response" as requested in their comment.
