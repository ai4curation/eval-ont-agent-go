## Changes Made

Modified file:
- `src/ontology/go-edit.obo` - Added new term GO:7770071

## Validation & Quality Checks

### ✓ PLAN
The issue and context were analyzed. The request is clear: add a new term for venom-mediated activation of inflammatory response with appropriate parent term GO:0035738.

### ✓ PRE-VALIDATION
Basic syntax validation performed. The go-edit.obo file was verified to have proper structure before and after changes.

### ✓ RESEARCH
Background research was performed on both provided PMIDs to validate biological accuracy:

**PMID:32024243** (Almeida et al., 2020, Toxins)
- Demonstrates that snake venom metalloproteinases (SVMPs) from Bothrops atrox induce inflammatory reactions
- Key findings: edema (~70% paw size increase), leukocyte infiltration (5-6 × 10⁶ cells), TNF-α production
- Mechanisms include direct action on inflammatory cells and release of proinflammatory peptides

**PMID:19000915** (Gomes et al., 2009, Toxicon)
- Characterizes metalloproteinase BthMP from Bothrops moojeni venom
- Demonstrates edema and leukocytic infiltrate as key inflammatory components
- Confirms the role of venom toxins in inflammatory activity

Both references are appropriate and validate the biological concept of venom-mediated inflammatory responses.

### ✓ TERM-SEARCH
Searched for related terms using `obo-grep.pl`:
- Parent term GO:0035738 (venom-mediated perturbation of biological process) confirmed
- Related terms examined: GO:0044398 (venom-mediated edema), GO:0044358 (venom-mediated hemorrhage)
- Main inflammatory response term GO:0006954 reviewed for context

### ✓ DESIGN-PATTERNS
Analyzed existing venom-mediated terms to ensure consistency:

**Naming pattern:** "venom-mediated <process/effect>" - ✓ Followed
**Definition pattern:** "A process by which an organism causes <effect> in another organism via the action of a venom." - ✓ Followed
**Logical definitions:** Other venom-mediated terms do NOT use intersection_of tags; they use simple is_a hierarchies - ✓ Consistent
**Synonym pattern:** Appropriate BROAD synonym "venom-mediated inflammation" added

The term structure is fully consistent with existing venom-mediated terms (GO:0044398, GO:0044358, etc.).

### ✓ EDITS
Proper checkout/checkin procedure followed:
1. Created term in `terms/GO_7770071.obo`
2. Used `obo-checkin.pl` to add term to go-edit.obo
3. Verified term was correctly inserted at line 617489

### ✓ RELATIONSHIPS
- **is_a:** GO:0035738 (venom-mediated perturbation of biological process) - appropriate parent as specified
- **No logical definition:** Consistent with design pattern; not needed for this type of complex multi-organism process term
- **No over-assertion:** Single is_a parent is sufficient and appropriate

### ✓ METADATA
- ✓ created_by and creation_date added (new term)
- ✓ namespace: biological_process specified
- ✓ term_tracker_item links to issue #31902
- ✓ Definition includes validated PMID references
- ✓ Synonym with appropriate scope (BROAD)

### ✓ AUTOMATED-VALIDATION
Basic syntax validation performed. ROBOT/ODK tools not available in this environment for full travis_build, but:
- Term structure verified manually
- File integrity checked (48,313 terms counted)
- Context around new term verified
- No syntax errors detected

### ✓ REFERENCE-VALIDATION
All references validated using `linkml-reference-validator`:
- PMID:32024243 - ✓ Valid, cached, and content verified
- PMID:19000915 - ✓ Valid, cached, and content verified
- All supporting text from RESEARCH.md validated against source abstracts
- No fabricated or hallucinated references

### ✓ CHANGES-COMMITTED
- ✓ Only src/ontology/go-edit.obo committed (no unrelated files)
- ✓ Detailed commit message with biological context
- ✓ Changes are biologically accurate and well-justified
- ✓ Changes align with issue request
- ✓ Proper git signature included

### N/A SPECIALIZED-EDITS
- N/A term-obsoletion: Not applicable (new term creation)
- N/A chemical-entity: Not applicable (no CHEBI involvement)
- N/A reaction: Not applicable (not a catalytic activity term)
- N/A taxon-constraint: Not specified in request
- N/A mapping: Not applicable for new term

## Biological Justification

The term describes a well-documented biological phenomenon where venom components (particularly snake venom metalloproteinases) induce inflammatory responses in envenomated organisms. The classical hallmarks of venom-mediated inflammation include:

1. **Edema** - tissue swelling from fluid accumulation
2. **Leukocyte infiltration** - immune cell recruitment
3. **Release of inflammatory mediators** - cytokines like TNF-α

These are supported by the provided literature and are appropriate biological phenomena to represent in GO for annotation of venom metalloproteinase gene products.

## Use Cases

This term is appropriate for annotating gene products such as:
- Snake venom metalloproteinases (e.g., UniProt: A0A0K2JNB8, P85420, P0DRN9)
- Other venom components that trigger inflammatory responses

## Consistency with GO Architecture

The term fits naturally into the existing GO hierarchy:
```
GO:0035821 ! modulation of process of another organism
  └─ GO:0035738 ! venom-mediated perturbation of biological process
      └─ GO:7770071 ! venom-mediated activation of inflammatory response (NEW)
```

This is consistent with related terms like:
- GO:0044398 ! venom-mediated edema (also child of GO:0035738)
- GO:0044358 ! venom-mediated hemorrhage
