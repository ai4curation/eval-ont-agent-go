# New Pattern Recognition Receptor Activity Terms for dsRNA and Z-RNA

This PR addresses issue #32046 by creating two new molecular function terms for pattern recognition receptors that recognize double-stranded RNA structures.

## Terms Created

### 1. GO:7770072 - double-stranded RNA immune receptor activity

```obo
id: GO:7770072
name: double-stranded RNA immune receptor activity
namespace: molecular_function
def: "Combining with a double-stranded RNA and transmitting the signal across the cell membrane to initiate an innate immune response." [PMID:23273991, PMID:33243852, PMID:34678144]
synonym: "dsRNA immune receptor activity" EXACT []
is_a: GO:0038187 ! pattern recognition receptor activity
intersection_of: GO:0038023 ! signaling receptor activity
intersection_of: has_primary_input CHEBI:67208 ! double-stranded RNA
relationship: has_part GO:0003725 ! double-stranded RNA binding
property_value: term_tracker_item "https://github.com/geneontology/go-ontology/issues/32046" xsd:anyURI
created_by: dragon-ai-agent
creation_date: 2026-05-14T07:31:44Z
```

**Biological context**: This term represents the activity of pattern recognition receptors (NLRP1, NLRP6, MDA5/IFIH1) that directly bind double-stranded RNA and initiate innate immune responses. dsRNA is a key pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) generated during viral replication.

### 2. GO:7770073 - left-handed Z-RNA immune receptor activity

```obo
id: GO:7770073
name: left-handed Z-RNA immune receptor activity
namespace: molecular_function
def: "Combining with a left-handed Z-RNA and transmitting the signal across the cell membrane to initiate an innate immune response. Z-RNA is a left-handed double helical form of RNA with a zigzag backbone." [PMID:32200799]
synonym: "Z-RNA immune receptor activity" EXACT []
is_a: GO:7770072 ! double-stranded RNA immune receptor activity
property_value: term_tracker_item "https://github.com/geneontology/go-ontology/issues/32046" xsd:anyURI
created_by: dragon-ai-agent
creation_date: 2026-05-14T07:31:44Z
```

**Biological context**: This term is specific to ZBP1 (Z-DNA/RNA binding protein 1), which recognizes the left-handed Z-form of dsRNA. Z-RNA is a conformational variant with a left-handed helix and zigzag backbone, generated during replication of certain viruses (influenza, vaccinia). ZBP1 activation initiates RIPK3-mediated necroptosis.

## Design Pattern Compliance

Both terms follow the established design pattern for immune receptor activities (children of GO:0038187):

**Pattern structure:**
- **Name**: `[ligand] immune receptor activity`
- **Definition**: `Combining with a [ligand] and transmitting the signal [across the cell membrane/to] initiate an innate immune response. [Optional context]`
- **Logical definition** (for term 1): 
  - Genus: GO:0038023 (signaling receptor activity)
  - Differentia: has_primary_input CHEBI:67208 (double-stranded RNA)
- **Relationships**: 
  - is_a to GO:0038187 (pattern recognition receptor activity)
  - has_part to corresponding binding activity

This pattern is consistent with existing sibling terms:
- GO:0001873 (polysaccharide immune receptor activity)
- GO:0001875 (lipopolysaccharide immune receptor activity)
- GO:0001877 (lipoarabinomannan immune receptor activity)
- GO:0016019 (peptidoglycan immune receptor activity)

**Note on logical definitions**: Term 1 includes full logical definitions using CHEBI:67208 for dsRNA. Term 2 uses a simpler axiomatization as a child of term 1, since Z-RNA is a conformational variant of dsRNA and currently lacks a specific CHEBI identifier (as noted by the requester, ChEBI cannot easily represent large molecules like dsRNA).

## Scientific Validation

All four PMIDs were validated and confirmed to support these terms:

- **PMID:33243852** (Bauernfried et al., Science 2021): "Biochemical studies revealed that NLRP1 binds dsRNA through its leucine-rich repeat domain, resulting in its NACHT domain gaining adenosine triphosphatase activity."

- **PMID:34678144** (Shen et al., Cell 2021): "NLRP6 undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) upon interaction with double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) in vitro and in cells...implicating NLRP6 LLPS in anti-microbial immunity."

- **PMID:23273991** (Wu et al., Cell 2013): "MDA5, a viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) receptor...we report here the crystal structure of MDA5 bound to dsRNA, which shows how...MDA5 recognizes the internal duplex structure."

- **PMID:32200799** (Zhang et al., Cell 2020): "Here, we show that replicating IAV generates Z-RNAs, which activate ZBP1 in the nucleus of infected cells. ZBP1 then initiates RIPK3-mediated MLKL activation in the nucleus."

## Files Modified

- `src/ontology/go-edit.obo`: Added GO:7770072 and GO:7770073

## Additional Notes

1. **Why no CHEBI term for Z-RNA?**: As noted by the requester, ChEBI cannot easily represent large molecules like double-stranded RNA. Z-RNA is a conformational variant of dsRNA (left-handed vs. right-handed helix), not a chemically distinct entity. Therefore, GO:7770073 uses a simpler axiomatization as a child of the dsRNA term rather than a full logical definition.

2. **Receptor specificity**: While the three receptors (NLRP1, NLRP6, MDA5) all recognize dsRNA, they have different length preferences and downstream signaling:
   - NLRP1: dsRNA >500 bp, activates inflammasome
   - NLRP6: Long dsRNA, phase separation-mediated inflammasome and interferon signaling
   - MDA5/IFIH1: Preferentially >2 kb dsRNA, activates MAVS for interferon production
   - ZBP1: Specifically recognizes Z-form dsRNA, initiates necroptosis

3. **Cross-species relevance**: These receptors function in multiple species, though with some variation (e.g., human vs. mouse NLRP1). The GO terms are appropriately generic to cover pan-species usage.

4. **Integration with existing GO structure**: The new terms fit naturally into the existing pattern recognition receptor hierarchy and follow the same design principles as established immune receptor activity terms.
