# PR: Add double-stranded RNA immune receptor activity terms

## Summary

Created two new molecular function terms for pattern recognition receptors that specifically recognize double-stranded RNA structures, as requested in issue #32046.

## Terms Created

### GO:7770072 - double-stranded RNA immune receptor activity
- **Definition**: "Combining with a double-stranded RNA and transmitting the signal across the cell membrane to initiate an innate immune response."
- **Parent**: GO:0038187 (pattern recognition receptor activity)
- **Synonym**: dsRNA immune receptor activity (EXACT)
- **References**: PMID:23273991, PMID:33243852, PMID:34678144
- **Examples**: NLRP1, NLRP6, MDA5/IFIH1

### GO:7770073 - left-handed Z-RNA immune receptor activity
- **Definition**: "Combining with a left-handed Z-RNA and transmitting the signal across the cell membrane to initiate an innate immune response."
- **Parent**: GO:7770072 (double-stranded RNA immune receptor activity)
- **References**: PMID:32200799
- **Example**: ZBP1

## Rationale and Design Decisions

### Naming and Definition Convention
Both terms follow the established pattern for immune receptor activity terms in GO:
- **Label pattern**: `<molecule> immune receptor activity`
- **Definition pattern**: "Combining with <molecule> and transmitting the signal across the cell membrane to initiate an innate immune response."

This is consistent with existing terms such as:
- GO:0001873 polysaccharide immune receptor activity
- GO:0001875 lipopolysaccharide immune receptor activity
- GO:0016019 peptidoglycan immune receptor activity

### Logical Definitions
The terms do NOT include logical definitions (intersection_of tags). This decision was made because:

1. **No external ontology reference available**: As noted in the issue, CHEBI cannot represent large molecules like double-stranded RNA and Z-RNA
2. **Incomplete axiomatization**: The standard pattern for receptor activity terms uses:
   ```
   intersection_of: GO:0038023 ! signaling receptor activity
   intersection_of: has_primary_input <ONTOLOGY_ID>
   ```
   Without an appropriate external ontology ID, the logical definition would be incomplete
3. **Best practice**: Per GO guidelines, it is better to use weaker axiomatization (simple is_a relationships) than incorrect or incomplete stronger axiomatization (intersection_of)

### Hierarchy
- GO:7770072 is a child of GO:0038187 (pattern recognition receptor activity)
- GO:7770073 is a child of GO:7770072, reflecting that Z-RNA is a specific form of dsRNA

## Background Research

All four PMIDs were validated:

### PMID:33243852 (Bauernfried et al., 2021, Science)
- Established human NLRP1 as a direct sensor for dsRNA
- dsRNA binding through leucine-rich repeat domain triggers inflammasome activation

### PMID:34678144 (Shen et al., 2021, Cell)
- Demonstrated NLRP6 undergoes phase separation upon dsRNA interaction
- Important for inflammasome activation during RNA virus infection

### PMID:23273991 (Wu et al., 2013, Cell)
- Revealed structural basis for MDA5 (IFIH1) recognition of dsRNA
- MDA5 recognizes internal duplex structures and activates antiviral signaling

### PMID:32200799 (Zhang et al., 2020, Cell)
- Identified Z-RNA as a pathogen-associated molecular pattern
- ZBP1 specifically recognizes left-handed Z-RNA and initiates necroptosis

## Notes

- These terms are important because CHEBI cannot represent large molecular structures like dsRNA
- The terms enable annotation of key innate immune receptors (NLRP1, NLRP6, MDA5, ZBP1)
- The hierarchical relationship (Z-RNA as a child of dsRNA) is biologically accurate
