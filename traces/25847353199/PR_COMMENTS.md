# Obsoletion of Ergothioneine Biosynthesis Pathway-Specific Terms

## Overview

This PR implements the obsoletion request from issue #32018, obsoleting two pathway-specific ergothioneine biosynthesis terms (GO:0052704 and GO:0140479) and replacing them with the parent term GO:0052699. MetaCyc pathway mappings are added to preserve pathway-specific information.

## Changes Made

### 1. GO:0052704 - Obsoleted (bacterial pathway)
- **Old status**: Active term for bacterial-specific ergothioneine biosynthesis
- **New status**: Obsolete, replaced by GO:0052699
- **Changes**:
  - Name prefixed with "obsolete"
  - Definition prefixed with "OBSOLETE."
  - Removed: is_a relationship, synonyms, Wikipedia xref
  - Added: obsoletion comment, is_obsolete: true, replaced_by: GO:0052699
  - Added: term_tracker_item for issue #32018

### 2. GO:0140479 - Obsoleted (fungal pathway)
- **Old status**: Active term for fungal-specific ergothioneine biosynthesis
- **New status**: Obsolete, replaced by GO:0052699
- **Changes**:
  - Name prefixed with "obsolete"
  - Definition prefixed with "OBSOLETE."
  - Removed: is_a relationship
  - Added: obsoletion comment, is_obsolete: true, replaced_by: GO:0052699
  - Added: term_tracker_item for issue #32018

### 3. GO:0052699 - Enhanced (parent term)
- **Status**: Active (no change)
- **Changes**:
  - Added: xref: MetaCyc:PWY-7255 {source="skos:narrowMatch"}
  - Added: xref: MetaCyc:PWY-7550 {source="skos:narrowMatch"}
  - Added: term_tracker_item for issue #32018

### 4. GO:0044875 - Rewired
- **Name**: gamma-glutamyl hercynylcysteine sulfoxide synthase activity
- **Change**: Rewired `part_of` relationship from GO:0052704 → GO:0052699
- **Rationale**: This MF term represents an activity that is part of ergothioneine biosynthesis generally, not just the bacterial variant
- Added: term_tracker_item for issue #32018

### 5. GO:0061686 - Rewired
- **Name**: hercynylcysteine sulfoxide synthase activity
- **Change**: Rewired `part_of` relationship from GO:0140479 → GO:0052699
- **Rationale**: This MF term represents an activity that is part of ergothioneine biosynthesis generally, not just the fungal variant
- Added: term_tracker_item for issue #32018

### 6. GO:0052707 - Updated
- **Name**: obsolete N-alpha,N-alpha,N-alpha-trimethyl-L-histidine biosynthesis from histidine
- **Status**: Already obsolete (no change)
- **Change**: Updated replaced_by from GO:0052704 → GO:0052699
- **Rationale**: With GO:0052704 now obsolete, replacement chain should point to active parent term
- Updated: obsoletion comment to reflect that GO:0052704 is now obsolete
- Added: term_tracker_item for issue #32018

## Rationale

### Why Obsolete These Terms?

1. **Beyond GO Scope**: These terms represent mechanistically-distinct pathway variants that are more detailed than typical GO biological process terms
2. **Organism-Specific**: The bacterial and fungal pathways differ in:
   - Number of enzymatic steps (5 vs 2)
   - Enzyme structure (separate vs fused proteins)
   - Thiol source (γ-glutamylcysteine vs cysteine)
   - Key intermediates (γ-glutamyl-hercynylcysteine sulfoxide vs hercynylcysteine sulfoxide)
3. **Better Representation**: Pathway-specific details are more appropriately captured in:
   - Pathway databases (MetaCyc PWY-7255 and PWY-7550)
   - GO-CAMs when pathway-level annotation is needed
4. **Historical Precedent**: Issue #11163 previously noted this concern

### Why MetaCyc narrowMatch?

The GO term GO:0052699 is deliberately broad to accommodate all organisms and mechanisms. The MetaCyc pathways represent specific mechanistic variants, making them narrower in scope than the general GO term. This follows standard GO practice for mapping general process terms to specific pathway implementations.
