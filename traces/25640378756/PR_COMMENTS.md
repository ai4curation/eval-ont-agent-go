## Changes Made

### New Term: p24 cargo receptor complex (GO:7770070)

[Term]
id: GO:7770070
name: p24 cargo receptor complex
namespace: cellular_component
def: "A conserved hetero-oligomeric cargo receptor complex localized to the endoplasmic reticulum exit sites. The complex cycles between the ER and Golgi apparatus, where it selectively recruits secretory cargo, especially GPI-anchored proteins, into COPII vesicles and mediates ER-to-Golgi transport. The p24 complex is also involved in retrograde COPI-mediated transport back to the ER." [PMID:32456004, PMID:34647572, PMID:27569046, PMID:19566487]

## Biological Justification

### The p24 Complex as a Distinct Entity

The p24 cargo receptor complex is a functionally and structurally distinct complex that cannot be decomposed into simpler terms. It:

1. **Functions as a specialized cargo receptor** for GPI-anchored proteins and other secretory cargo
2. **Forms hetero-oligomeric assemblies** containing one member each of four p24 subfamilies (α, β, γ, δ)
3. **Cycles between ER and Golgi** - actively participates in bidirectional transport
4. **Localizes to specific compartments** - ER exit sites for anterograde transport, and back to ER via COPI

### Design Pattern Compliance

**Pattern Used:** Complex term with activity-based logical definition pattern

The term follows the design pattern established by GO:0062137 (cargo receptor complex):
- Parent: protein-containing complex
- Capable of: cargo receptor activity
- Localized to: membrane (specifically ER and ER exit sites)

The term is defined with simple is_a relationship to parent, allowing the logical definition of cargo receptor complex to be inherited:
- is_a GO:0062137 ! cargo receptor complex

Additional relationship captures localization:
- relationship: part_of GO:0070971 ! endoplasmic reticulum exit site

### Relationship to Parent Term

**GO:0062137 (cargo receptor complex)** has the following logical definition:
```
intersection_of: GO:0032991 ! protein-containing complex
intersection_of: capable_of GO:0038024 ! cargo receptor activity
intersection_of: part_of GO:0016020 ! membrane
```

By using is_a to this parent, GO:7770070 inherits these axioms and additionally specifies:
- Specific localization to ER exit sites (where COPII coating occurs)
- Specific cargo preference (GPI-anchored proteins)
- Bidirectional cycling between ER and Golgi

## Notes for Reviewers

1. **Specific Cargo Preference:** The definition specifically mentions GPI-anchored proteins, which is supported by the primary references. This is appropriate for a specific type of cargo receptor complex.

2. **Bidirectional Function:** The definition captures both anterograde (ER→Golgi, COPII) and retrograde (Golgi→ER, COPI) roles, which aligns with the biological mechanism described in the research.

3. **ER Exit Site Localization:** While the parent term is more broadly "part_of membrane", the specific localization to ER exit sites (ERES) is important for p24 function and is captured via relationship.

4. **Hetero-oligomeric Assembly:** The definition mentions this is a "conserved hetero-oligomeric" complex to reflect the multi-subunit nature essential to function, as evidenced by the structural studies (PMID:27569046).

5. **Future Annotations:** This term is ready for annotations to:
   - Yeast p24 proteins: ERP1, ERP2, ERP3, ERP4, ERP5, ERP6, EMP24, ERV25
   - Human orthologs: TMED2, TMED3, TMED4, TMED9, TMED10
   - And their orthologs in other model organisms
