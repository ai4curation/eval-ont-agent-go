# PR: Rename GO:1990334 to species-agnostic "SIN/MEN two-component GAP complex"

## Overview

This PR addresses issue #31636 by renaming GO:1990334 from the species-specific "Bfa1-Bub2 complex" to the species-agnostic "SIN/MEN two-component GAP complex". The changes make the term applicable across yeast species while preserving species-specific protein names as narrow synonyms.

## Changes Made

### Term Renaming
- **Old name**: Bfa1-Bub2 complex
- **New name**: SIN/MEN two-component GAP complex

### Synonyms Added
- **NARROW**: "Bfa1-Bub2 complex" (budding yeast *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*)
- **NARROW**: "Byr4-Cdc16 GAP complex" (fission yeast *Schizosaccharomyces pombe*)

### Definition Updated
**Old definition**: 
"A protein complex that acts as a two-component GTPase-activating protein for Tem1 GTPase, thus regulating a signal transduction cascade, called the mitotic exit network (MEN), which is required for mitotic exit and cytokinesis. Bub2/Bfa1 keeps Tem1 inactive until the spindle is properly oriented, thus inhibiting MEN activation."

**New definition**: 
"A protein complex that acts as a two-component GTPase-activating protein, thus regulating a signal transduction cascade that controls mitotic exit and cytokinesis. In budding yeast, the Bub2-Bfa1 complex regulates the Tem1 GTPase as part of the mitotic exit network (MEN). In fission yeast, the Byr4-Cdc16 complex regulates the Spg1 GTPase as part of the septation initiation network (SIN)."

### References Updated
- Added PMID:11715048 (Bardin & Amon 2001 review "Men and sin: what's the difference?")
- Added PMID:9742395 (Furge et al. 1998 on Byr4-Cdc16 GAP complex)
- Retained PMID:16449187 (Fraschini et al. 2006 on Bub2-Bfa1)

### Metadata
- Added `term_tracker_item` linking to issue #31636
- Preserved original `created_by` and `creation_date` (not modified as this is an edit, not creation)

## Rationale

The MEN (Mitotic Exit Network) in budding yeast and SIN (Septation Initiation Network) in fission yeast are homologous pathways that control mitotic exit and cytokinesis. Both pathways feature a two-component GTPase-activating protein complex:

- **Budding yeast**: Bub2-Bfa1 complex → regulates Tem1 GTPase (MEN)
- **Fission yeast**: Byr4-Cdc16 complex → regulates Spg1 GTPase (SIN)

The original term name "Bfa1-Bub2 complex" was species-specific to budding yeast. The new name "SIN/MEN two-component GAP complex" accurately reflects:
1. The functional nature (two-component GAP)
2. The pathways in which it participates (SIN and MEN)
3. Applicability across yeast species

This follows GO's best practice of using species-agnostic primary terms with species-specific synonyms.

## Validation

All automated validation checks passed:
- SPARQL constraint checks: 20/20 passed
- OWL reasoning with ELK: successful
- No violations or errors reported

## Files Modified

- `src/ontology/go-edit.obo`: Updated GO:1990334

## Research Documentation

Background research was performed and documented in RESEARCH.md (temporary file, not committed). Key findings:

1. **MEN and SIN are conserved pathways**: Both control exit from mitosis and cytokinesis
2. **Two-component GAP**: Both complexes function as two-component GTPase-activating proteins
3. **Species-specific composition**:
   - Budding yeast: Bfa1 + Bub2
   - Fission yeast: Byr4 + Cdc16
4. **Homologous GTPase targets**:
   - Budding yeast: Tem1
   - Fission yeast: Spg1

All references were validated using linkml-reference-validator to ensure no typos or hallucinations.
