# Description

Addresses geneontology/go-ontology#32005.

Obsoleted GO:0009095 `aromatic amino acid biosynthetic process, prephenate pathway` because it represents a pre-composed/superpathway term combining L-phenylalanine and L-tyrosine biosynthesis via prephenate.

Changes made in `src/ontology/go-edit.obo`:

- Renamed the term to `obsolete aromatic amino acid biosynthetic process, prephenate pathway`.
- Prefixed the definition with `OBSOLETE.` while preserving the original definition xrefs.
- Removed synonyms, xref, asserted parent, and logical axioms from the obsolete term.
- Added obsoletion comment.
- Added tracker link for issue #32005, retaining the existing tracker link for #31091.
- Added `is_obsolete: true`.
- Added `consider` targets:
  - GO:0009094 `L-phenylalanine biosynthetic process`
  - GO:0006571 `L-tyrosine biosynthetic process`

# Rationale

The requested obsoletion is consistent with the existing GO biosynthetic-process pattern, which composes terms by primary output. The two product-specific terms already exist and carry the relevant MetaCyc narrowMatch xrefs:

- GO:0009094 has `MetaCyc:PWY-3462` as `skos:narrowMatch`.
- GO:0006571 has `MetaCyc:PWY-3461` as `skos:narrowMatch`.

GO:0009095 instead corresponds to the combined MetaCyc superpathway (`PWY-3481`) and had a broad output (`aromatic amino acid`) plus prephenate intermediate, so retaining it as a GO process term would preserve a pre-composed/superpathway representation rather than a clean product-specific biosynthetic process.

# Research and annotation notes

Created `RESEARCH.md` locally for the cited publications and validated quoted support text with `linkml-reference-validator`:

- PMID:21102469: supports PPA-AT directing flux toward arogenate and plant phenylalanine biosynthesis; supports review of the Petunia PPA-AT annotation for possible migration to GO:0009094.
- PMID:20883697: biochemical identification/characterization of Arabidopsis prephenate aminotransferase; abstract-level evidence does not clearly support retaining a specific BP annotation to the combined superpathway term.
- PMID:18727669: biochemical/structural characterization of chorismate mutase; abstract-level evidence does not clearly support a BP annotation to the combined superpathway term.

Attempted `runoak -i amigo: associations GO:0009095`, but the local harness OAK installation failed with a LinkML `Format.JSON` import error. I therefore relied on the annotation impact analysis provided in the issue, plus local reference validation of the PMIDs.

# Validation

- Pre-validation: `cd src/ontology && make travis_build` passed before edits.
- Post-edit validation: `cd src/ontology && make travis_build` passed after edits.
- Checked GO-internal usage with `obo-grep.pl`; GO:0009095 is now only present in its own obsolete stanza.
- Checked local taxon-constraint and ontology files for GO:0009095; no additional ontology/taxon-constraint references needed rewiring.

# Checklist

- [x] PLAN: Issue and context analyzed; intent clear: obsolete GO:0009095 as a combined/pre-composed superpathway term.
- [x] PRE-VALIDATION: Current ontology validated with `make travis_build` before changes.
- [x] RESEARCH: Created local `RESEARCH.md`; PMIDs from the issue were cached and quoted support text validated.
- [x] TERM-SEARCH: Consulted GO:0009095, GO:0009094, GO:0006571 and MetaCyc xref usage in `go-edit.obo`.
- [x] DESIGN-PATTERNS: Created local `DESIGN_PATTERNS.md`; reviewed `biosynthetic_process.yaml` and existing product-specific biosynthetic terms.
- [x] EDITS: Used `obo-checkout.pl` / `obo-checkin.pl` and edited the term-specific file under `terms/`.
- [x] RELATIONSHIPS: Removed all `is_a`, `relationship`, and `intersection_of` tags from the obsolete term; added `consider` terms only.
  - [x] Logical definitions are N/A for the obsolete term and were removed.
  - [x] Relationships conform to obsoletion practice.
  - [x] `is_a` is not over-asserted; obsolete term has none.
- [x] SPECIALIZED-EDITS:
  - [x] `/term-obsoletion` skill used.
  - [x] `/chemical-entity` skill consulted because the original term used CHEBI in logical axioms; no new CHEBI axioms were added.
  - [x] `/reaction` N/A.
  - [x] `/taxon-constraint` N/A; no taxon constraint rows found for GO:0009095.
- [x] METADATA: Added issue #32005 `term_tracker_item`; retained existing namespace and historical definition provenance; no `created_by`/`creation_date` added because this is not a new term.
- [x] AUTOMATED-VALIDATION: `make travis_build` passed after changes.
- [x] REFERENCE-VALIDATION: PMIDs from the issue were cached and support quotes validated; no new definition references introduced.
- [x] CHANGES-COMMITTED:
  - [x] RELEVANT-FILES: Committed only `src/ontology/go-edit.obo`.
  - [x] ACCURACY: Change aligns with product-specific biosynthetic process design and existing MetaCyc mappings.
  - [x] ISSUE-ALIGNMENT: Change directly implements requested obsoletion with the requested consider terms.
